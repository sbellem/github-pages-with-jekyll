# Darkness within darkness ... walking into the unknown
To know and to not know
Welcoming and dwelling in not knowing
The courage to think
Being
Where does knowledge come from?
What exists before knowing?
What precedes knowing?
What is the prerequisite to knowing?
Can you know that you do not know?
If you know that you do not know?
Who knows, and who does not know?
Are they the same?
Is knowing something the same as knowing nothing?
Is knowing something the same as just knowing?
Is just knowing the same as knowing nothing?
Is nothing something?
Is knowing something different than knowing nothing?
I know. I don't know. I am. I. .
